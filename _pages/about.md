I am a research scientist/project leader in the [Structural and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/structural-and-molecular-biophysics-collaboration/) group at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/). My research focuses on structural and molecular biophysics, in particular the modeling and analysis of experimental data and simulations to understand the molecular mechanisms of biological temperature sensing. 

After receiving my B.S. in Biophysics from the University of Southern Calfornia, I became an NIH-Oxford-Cambridge Biomedical Research Scholar and obtained my Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of Oxford, studying the temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. After that I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics, Columbia University, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where I combined experimental and computational methods to study temperature-sensitive bacterial sodium channels, extracting continuous conformational heterogeneity from cryo-EM datasets, and how to design better targeted therapies to kinases, respectively.
