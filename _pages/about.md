I am a research scientist/project leader in the [Structural and Molecular Biophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/structural-and-molecular-biophysics-collaboration/) group at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/). My research focuses on structural and molecular biophysics, in particular the modeling and analysis of experimental data and simulations to understand the molecular mechanisms of biological temperature sensing. 

I received my PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Oxford, studying the temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. After that I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics, Columbia University, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where I combined experimental and computational methods to study temperature-sensitive bacterial sodium channels, extracting continuous conformational heterogeneity from cryo-EM datasets, and how to design better targeted therapies to kinases, respectively. She has a B.S. in Biophysics from the University of Southern California.
